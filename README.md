# Prework - *ColorShift*

Submitted by: **Salma Mohammad**

**ColorShift** is a simple iOS app that displays three labels (my name, my university, and my career goal) as well as a button. When the button is tapped, the background color of the app changes to a random color. he purpose of the app is to introduce basic iOS development concepts while creating a fun and interactive user experience. 

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- **Notion** – I love the customizable layouts and how everything stays organized
- **Google Calendar** – Reminders and color-coded events make planning easier
- **Duolingo** – The gamified learning and streak tracking keeps me motivated
- **Spotify** – The ability to make playlists and discover new music is so smooth; also Spotify Wrapped is a fun feature

**App Idea:**
An app called CRIL **Connect** that helps people with disabilities easily find and access local community resources. It’s inspired by the services offered by CRIL in Hayward, where I volunteer. The app would include features like a service directory (for housing, assistive tech, job help, etc.), appointment scheduling, travel training, and emergency alerts. The goal is to make everything easier to access in one simple app. I’d also want to make sure it’s screen-reader friendly and available in multiple languages so it can better serve the whole community.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

This prework assignment was my first time using Xcode. Getting used to the layout and how everything connects (like linking UI to code with `@IBAction`) took some trial and error. I also wasn’t familiar with GitHub Desktop, but once I figured out how to push my project and update the README, it made more sense. Recording and uploading the GIF walkthrough was a new skill for me too, but it was cool to see everything come together.
